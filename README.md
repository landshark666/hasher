# Huh?
Dumb file hashing utility.

I needed a (Windows) program I could drag and drop files onto and generate hashes to validate downloads. There's already other programs out there that do this, but I wanted to learn some golang so I ended up with this.

Do what you want with it.

A windows bat file is included so files can be dragged and dropped onto it and a command prompt will remain open with the hashesh.
